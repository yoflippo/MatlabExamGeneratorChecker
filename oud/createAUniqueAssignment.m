% DESCRIPTION:
%               This function reads all subfolders of the assignment
%               folders and its content. From every subfolder one m-file is
%               randomly selected. This m-file is placed in a folder
%               corresponding to the student.
%               Afterwards if the folder is filled a corresponding folder
%               is created with the answer files.
