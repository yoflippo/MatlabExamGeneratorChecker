    % where X is between 1..n with n being the number of available assignments)
    
    % each student gets it own subfolder in the folder called 'student-assignments'
    
    % Iterate through the list of students. Give the first student the for the
    % first assignment the assignment with the corresponding randomized number.
    % Repeat this for the following assignments. Remark: because the e-mail
    % list is shuffled and the starting point of each personalised assignment
    % generation is random no patterns should be present. Every student gets a
    % truly randomised set of assignments
    
    % Zip the assignment and give it the student number corresponding to the
    % student.
