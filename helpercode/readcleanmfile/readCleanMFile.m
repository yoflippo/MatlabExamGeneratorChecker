% DESCRIPTION:
%               A function that literally reads a txt-file. Also taking in
%               to account the empty lines. Other functions as: txtscan(),
%               fgetl(), fgets() appear not to have this option. The
%               function fileread() makes one long string of a file, so
%               that is no option eather.
